# Bubble Sort
Algorithms

/* ALGORITHM
1. Initialise a swap counter to non - zero
2. while swap count is not zero
    3. set swap counter to zero
    4. for all for all elements in an array
        5. check adjacent elements of the array
        6. if j > j + 1 then swap them
        7.increment the swap counter by 1

// LOGIC
1. While selection sort will sort the array from left to right, bubble sort will do that from right to left
2. Largest number is bubbled to the rightmost position of the array with every step
3. This process is faster since we do not consider the sorted elements again */
